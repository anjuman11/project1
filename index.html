	<p style="background-color:blueviolet; color:wheat; font-size: 120%;">Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. <b>It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.</b> <i>It was <mark>popularised</mark> in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</i></p>
